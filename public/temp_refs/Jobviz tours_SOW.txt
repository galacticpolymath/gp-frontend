Goal: 
Create a new GP+ function: the ability to create Jobiz Career Tours.


Details:
UX:
1. Teachers will see a new section on the homepage, a new tab “JobViz”, and content type: “Job Tours”
2. We already have prebuilt tours associated with all our units, that have a generic assignment. We want teachers to be able to build their own tours and share them (optionally) with other teachers in our community. So we’re not only building a new function, but need to create a new upsell section on the homepage and a way for teachers to explore jobviz tours (via a new tab and content type nested under search).
3. We also need to design buttons that allow teachers to create, copy/fork, and save their tours, either from scratch or using one of our pre-made tours or another teacher’s tour in the public gallery as a template.
4. Editing should be through a new “editing mode” that only GP+ members can enter, that takes advantage of the top- and side-dock panels to “collect/bookmark” jobs for the tour.
5. In editing mode, we should have the little dots in the upper right of cards (and card detail modals) be clickable. A tooltip should explain the dot button “Click to add job to tour”. When clicked it should turn bright, as it looks on the current tours and animate into the Jobs Tour Assignment panel. These get mapped to “selectedJobs”
6. The panel should have a few fields above the collected jobs for teachers to customize their tours. These items should be stored with user data on MongoDB via the API when saved:
   1. Field for: “heading”, which should be labeled “Title”, placeholder text=”What is this job tour?”
   2. Dropdown for “whoCanSee”: options "just-teachers" | "me" | "everyone".
   3. Field for: “explanation”, which should be labeled “Classroom Context”, placeholder text=”(Optional) When in the school year or how might this be useful to implement?”
   4. classSubject: Dropdown, with optional Other category that opens up a new field to enter custom subject. Default options (should be alphabetized: Science, Math, ELA, Social Studies
   5. gradeLevel: Dropdown, options: Upper elementary, middle school, high school, college
   6. Field for “tags”. Placeholder: “Add tags, separated by commas”
   7. Field for “Assignment”: Placeholder: “Describe for students what you want them to do”
   8. Dropdown of checkboxes for “gpUnitsAssociated”. Should be autopopulated with Titles of GP units.
   9. Save button at the bottom will connect to API.
7. Once saved, job tours should show up in a new “My JobViz Tours” section in the /account page.
8. All unit tours and publicly shared tours of other users should be searchable.
9. “isGP” should be a boolean controlled by whether it’s a premade Unit tour or a tour built by user matt@galacticpolymath.com, with ability to add other users in the future.

================================================================================
NOTES
================================================================================


1. All routes use MongoDB for data storage
2. Database connection timeout is 15,000ms (15 seconds)
3. The create route requires JWT authentication via Authorization header
4. The create route automatically generates _id, createdDate, lastEdited, and sets userId from JWT token
5. The create route automatically sets isGP to true if user email is in VALID_GP_USERS
6. The update route automatically updates the lastEdited field to current date/time (cannot be explicitly set)
7. The update route does not allow modification of _id, userId, isGP, createdDate, or lastEdited fields
8. The update route requires at least one field in the updates object
9. The get route only allows filtering by userId or heading (heading uses case-insensitive regex)
10. The delete route accepts a single ID or multiple IDs via the ids query parameter
11. All error responses follow a consistent format with a "msg" field
12. JSON stringified parameters in query strings must be properly URL-encoded
13. Date fields should be in ISO 8601 format (e.g., "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z")
