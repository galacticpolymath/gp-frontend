We want to improve the lives of teachers, students, and researchers because we have been in all of those roles. We are also keenly interested in amplifying marginalized voices (particularly those of indigenous peoples around the world), not only because representation matters, but because diverse perspectives lead to better solutions. We are working toward a future where education is bolder, more creative, more equitable, and where organizational outreach truly has Broader Impacts.
