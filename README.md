Task for review in this PR:

    -ensure 1:1 aspect ratios for all images
    
    -Decrease all font size...I'd use the Lessons page as a guideline 
    
    -Clear repeated console errors related to CardContainer and InstallHook:
        -bug is not appearing in my console, even after pulling the latest version of the branch
        
    -What do we do?: Make border color around icons lighter: #D0B4BF
    
    -left align Let's talk in header on desktop...I think 
    it looks weird out there the way I originally had it
    
    -increase right margin on Tier 3 so price tiers are equally spaced
    
    -include ? in <a> tag triggering modal in How much does it cost section. 
    Should be able to click ? to see more
    
    -include product banner in <a> tag
    
    -Can we vertically align (align middle?) all the quotes, 
    so short quotes aren't way up at the top and attribution way at bottom?
    
    -How does it work?
    
    -decrease vertical space between Constellation logo and "Each Lesson is" on >1200 width
